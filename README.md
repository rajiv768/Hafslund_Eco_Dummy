[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/brygrill/wab-react-webpack.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/brygrill/wab-react-webpack)

> ### Heads Up! As of v1.2, components have been migrated to [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

## How It Works

Webpack bundles all source code into a single React component. That component is
rendered in `Widget.js` with React DOM. See [the docs](docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md) for
more details.
